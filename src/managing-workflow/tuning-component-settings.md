# Tuning Component Settings

Helm Charts are a set of Kubernetes manifests that reflect best practices for deploying an
application or service. Helm is heavily influenced by [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), including the
[formula model](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core). A Helm Chart is to Helm as a Formula
is to Homebrew.

After you fetch the Workflow chart, you can customize the chart using `helmc edit` before using
`helmc generate` and `helmc install` to complete the installation. To customize the respective
component, edit `tpl/deis-<component>-deployment.yaml` and modify the `env` section of the component to
tune these settings.

For example, to allow only administrators to register new accounts in the controller,
edit `tpl/deis-controller-deployment.yaml` and add the following under the `env` section:

```yaml
env:
  - name: REGISTRATION_MODE
    value: "admin_only"
```

## Setting Resource limits

You can set resource limits to Workflow components by modifying the template file `tpl/generate_params.toml`.
This file has a section for each Workflow component. To set a limit to any Workflow component just add `limits_cpu`, `limits_memory`
in the section and set them to the appropriate values.

Below is an example of how the builder section of `tpl/generate_params.toml` might look with CPU and memory limits set:

```toml
[builder]
org = "deisci"
pullPolicy = "Always"
dockerTag = "canary"
limits_cpu = "100m"
limits_memory = "50Mi"
```

## Customizing the Builder

The following environment variables are tunable for the [Builder][] component:

Setting | Description
------- | ---------------------------------
DEBUG   | Enable debug log output (default: false)

## Customizing the Controller

The following environment variables are tunable for the [Controller][] component:

Setting                                         | Description
----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------
REGISTRATION_MODE                               | set registration to "enabled", "disabled", or "admin_only" (default: "enabled")
GUNICORN_WORKERS                                | number of [gunicorn][] workers spawned to process requests (default: CPU cores * 4 + 1)
RESERVED_NAMES                                  | a comma-separated list of names which applications cannot reserve for routing (default: "deis, deis-builder, deis-workflow-manager")
SLUGRUNNER_IMAGE_NAME                           | the image used to run buildpack application slugs (default: "quay.io/deisci/slugrunner:canary")

### Global and per application settings

Setting                                         | Description
----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------
DEIS_DEPLOY_BATCHES                             | the number of pods to bring up and take down sequentially during a scale (default: number of available nodes)
DEIS_DEPLOY_TIMEOUT                             | deploy timeout in seconds per deploy batch (default: 120)
IMAGE_PULL_POLICY                               | the kubernetes [image pull policy][pull-policy] for application images (default: "IfNotPresent") (allowed values: "Always", "IfNotPresent")
KUBERNETES_DEPLOYMENTS_REVISION_HISTORY_LIMIT   | how many [revisions][[kubernetes-deployment-revision]] Kubernetes keeps around of a given Deployment (default: all revisions)
KUBERNETES_POD_TERMINATION_GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS | how many seconds kubernetes waits for a pod to finish work after a SIGTERM before sending SIGKILL (default: 30)

See the [Deploying Apps][] guide for more detailed information on those.

## Customizing the Database

The following environment variables are tunable for the [Database][] component:

Setting           | Description
----------------- | ---------------------------------
BACKUP_FREQUENCY  | how often the database should perform a base backup (default: "12h")
BACKUPS_TO_RETAIN | number of base backups the backing store should retain (default: 5)

## Customizing Fluentd

The following environment variables are tunable for [Fluentd][logger]:

Setting           | Description
----------------- | ---------------------------------
SYSLOG_HOST_1     | The hostname of a remote syslog endpoint for shipping logs
SYSLOG_PORT_1     | The port of a remote syslog endpoint for shipping logs

## Customizing the Logger

The following environment variables are tunable for the [Logger][] component:

Setting           | Description
----------------- | ---------------------------------
STORAGE_ADAPTER   | How to store logs that are sent to the logger. Legal values are "file", "memory", and "redis". (default: "redis")
NUMBER_OF_LINES   | How many lines to store in the ring buffer (default: 1000)

## Customizing the Monitor

The monitor component uses [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) under the hood, and
derives most of its configuration from it. Please see
[telegraf configuration](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md)
for more information on tuning the [Monitor][] component.

## Customizing the Registry

The [Registry][] component can be tuned by following the
[deis/distribution config doc](https://github.com/deis/distribution/blob/master/docs/configuration.md).

## Customizing the Router

The majority of router settings are tunable through annotations, which allows the router to be
re-configured with zero downtime post-installation. You can find the list of annotations to tune
[here](https://github.com/deis/router#annotations).

The following environment variables are tunable for the [Router][] component:

Setting           | Description
----------------- | ---------------------------------
POD_NAMESPACE     | The pod namespace the router resides in. This is set by the [Kubernetes downward API][downward-api].

## Customizing Workflow Manager

The following environment variables are tunable for [Workflow Manager][]:

Setting                            | Description
---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------
CHECK_VERSIONS    | Enables the external version check at <https://versions.deis.com/> (default: "true")
POLL_INTERVAL_SEC | The interval when Workflow Manager performs a version check, in seconds (default: 43200, or 12 hours)
VERSIONS_API_URL  | The versions API URL (default: "<https://versions-staging.deis.com>")
DOCTOR_API_URL    | The doctor API URL (default: "<https://doctor-staging.deis.com>")
API_VERSION       | The version number Workflow Manager sends to the versions API (default: "v2")
