# Users and Registration

There are two classes of Workflow users: normal users and administrators.

 * Users can use most of the features of Workflow - creating and deploying applications, adding/removing domains, etc.
 * Administrators can perform all the actions that users can, but they also have owner access to all applications.

The first user created on a Workflow installation is automatically an administrator.

## Register with a Controller

Use `deis register` with the [Controller][] URL (supplied by your Deis administrator)
to create a new account. After successful registration you will be logged in as the new user.

```shell
$ deis register http://deis.example.com
username: myuser
password:
password (confirm):
email: myuser@example.com
Registered myuser
Logged in as myuser
```

!!! important
    The first user to register with Deis Workflow automatically becomes an administrator. Additional users who register will be ordinary users.

## Login to Workflow

If you already have an account, use `deis login` to authenticate against the Deis Workflow API.

```shell
$ deis login http://deis.example.com
username: deis
password:
Logged in as deis
```

## Logout from Workflow

Logout of an existing controller session using `deis logout`.

```shell
$ deis logout
Logged out as deis
```

## Verify Your Session

You can verify your client configuration by running `deis whoami`.

```shell
$ deis whoami
You are deis at http://deis.example.com
```

!!! note
    Session and client configuration is stored in the `~/.deis/client.json` file.

## Controlling Registration Modes

After creating your first user, you may wish to change the registration mode for Deis Workflow.

Deis Workflow supports three registration modes:

| Mode              | Description                                     |
| ---               | ---                                             |
| enabled (default) | Registration is enabled and anyone can register |
| disabled          | Does not allow anyone to register new users.    |
| admin\_only       | Only existing admins may register new users     |

To modify the registration mode for Workflow you may add or modify the `REGISTRATION_MODE` environment variable for the
controller component. If Deis Workflow is already running, use:

`kubectl --namespace=deis patch deployments deis-controller -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"deis-controller","env":[{"name":"REGISTRATION_MODE","value":"disabled"}]}]}}}}'`

Modify the `value` portion to match the desired mode.

Kubernetes will automatically deploy a new ReplicaSet and corresponding Pod with the new environment variables set.

## Managing Administrative Permissions

You can use the `deis perms` command to promote a user to an admin:

```shell
$ deis perms:create john --admin
Adding john to system administrators... done
```

View current admins:

```shell
$ deis perms:list --admin
=== Administrators
admin
john
```

Demote admins to normal users:

```shell
$ deis perms:delete john --admin
Removing john from system administrators... done
```

## Re-issuing User Authentication Tokens

The controller API uses a simple token-based HTTP Authentication scheme. Token authentication is appropriate for
client-server setups, such as native desktop and mobile clients. Each user of the platform is issued a token the first
time that they sign up on the platform. If this token is compromised, it will need to be regenerated.

A user can regenerate their own token like this:

```shell
$ deis auth:regenerate
```

An administrator can also regenerate the token of another user like this:

```shell
$ deis auth:regenerate -u test-user
```

At this point, the user will no longer be able to authenticate against the controller with his auth token:

```shell
$ deis apps
401 UNAUTHORIZED
Detail:
Invalid token
```

They will need to log back in to use their new auth token.

If there is a cluster wide security breach, an administrator can regenerate everybody's auth token like this:

```shell
$ deis auth:regenerate --all=true
```

## Changing Account Password

A user can change their own account's password like this:

```shell
$ deis auth:passwd
current password:
new password:
new password (confirm):
```

An administrator can change the password of another user's account like this:

```shell
$ deis auth:passwd --username=<username>
new password:
new password (confirm):
```
