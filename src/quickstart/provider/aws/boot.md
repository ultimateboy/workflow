# Booting Kubernetes on Amazon Elastic Compute

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides compute capacity in the cloud. This quickstart
guide uses AWS EC2 to boot a Kubernetes cluster using the open source provisioning scripts.

## Pre-requisites

1. You need an active AWS account. Visit [](http://aws.amazon.com) to sign up
2. You need AWS API keys with full access
3. Install the AWS cli tools, you can find instructions for your platform at [](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

To verify that your CLI is configured properly, run `aws ec2 describe-regions`:

```shell
$ aws ec2 describe-regions
REGIONS	ec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com	eu-west-1
REGIONS	ec2.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com	ap-southeast-1
REGIONS	ec2.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com	ap-southeast-2
REGIONS	ec2.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com	eu-central-1
REGIONS	ec2.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com	ap-northeast-2
REGIONS	ec2.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com	ap-northeast-1
REGIONS	ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com	us-east-1
REGIONS	ec2.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com	sa-east-1
REGIONS	ec2.us-west-1.amazonaws.com	us-west-1
REGIONS	ec2.us-west-2.amazonaws.com	us-west-2
```

## Download and Unpack Kubernetes

First, make a directory to hold the Kubernetes release files:

```shell
$ mkdir my-first-cluster
$ cd my-first-cluster
```

See [Kubernetes Versions](https://deis.com/docs/workflow/installing-workflow/system-requirements/#kubernetes-versions) under System Requirements and download a Kubernetes release that is compatible with Deis Workflow, and extract the archive on your machine.

This archive has everything that you need to launch Kubernetes. It's a fairly large archive, so it may take some time to download:

```shell
$ curl -sSL https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.3.5/kubernetes.tar.gz -O
$ tar -xvzf kubernetes.tar.gz
$ cd kubernetes
$ ls
LICENSES     README.md    Vagrantfile  cluster/     contrib/     docs/        examples/    platforms/   server/      third_party/ version
```

## Configure the Kubernetes Environment

Before calling the Kubernetes setup scripts, we need to change a few defaults so that Deis Workflow works best. Type
each of these commands into your terminal application before calling `kube-up.sh`.

Next, pick the AWS Availability Zone you would like to use. The boot script will create a new VPC in that region.

```shell
$ export KUBE_AWS_ZONE=us-west-1c
$ export KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=aws
```

For evaluation, we find that the t2 instance classes are a reasonable bang for the buck. Do note that the t2 class does
track CPU credits. Performance of your evaluation cluster may be impacted when you exhaust the CPU credit limit. Select
your instance sizes and worker count.

```shell
$ export MASTER_SIZE=t2.medium
$ export NODE_SIZE=t2.large
$ export NUM_NODES=2
$ export NODE_ROOT_DISK_SIZE=100
```

Last, so you can easily identify instances in the AWS Console, specify an instance prefix:
```shell
$ export INSTANCE_PREFIX=first-k8s
```

## Boot Your First Cluster

We are now ready to boot our first Kubernetes cluster on AWS!

Since this script does a **lot** of stuff, we'll break it into sections.

```shell
$ ./cluster/kube-up.sh
Creating a kubernetes on aws...
... Starting cluster in us-west-1c using provider aws
... calling verify-prereqs
... calling kube-up
Starting cluster using os distro: jessie

  SERVER_BINARY_TAR_URL: ...
  SALT_TAR_URL: ...

```

Here, we have downloaded the Kubernetes release archive and started the process of cluster provisioning. Release
artifacts are automatically pushed to S3 for use by machines as they are provisioned.

```

Next, the VPC is provisioned with all of the necessary bits including security groups, route tables, subnets and
internet gateways.

```

```

Now that the master instance has booted, the script automatically configures your `kubectl` tool with appropriate
authentication and endpoint information.

```
cluster "aws_kubernetes" set.
user "aws_kubernetes" set.
context "aws_kubernetes" set.
switched to context "aws_kubernetes".
user "aws_kubernetes-basic-auth" set.
Wrote config for aws_kubernetes to /Users/jhansen/.kube/config
```

Up next, worker nodes are provisioned by an auto-scaling group, and we wait for those nodes to come up.

```

  This will continually check to see if the API for kubernetes is reachable.
  This might loop forever if there was some uncaught error during start
  up.

## Items of note!

A few things to note! Your Kubernetes master is now up and running and we are ready to install Deis Workflow. If you
need to access the Kubernetes master the default username is `admin` and the ssh key lives at `~/.ssh/kube_aws_rsa`.

```shell
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/kube_aws_rsa admin@52.9.206.49

Welcome to Kubernetes v1.2.4!

You can find documentation for Kubernetes at:
  http://docs.kubernetes.io/

You can download the build image for this release at:
  https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.2.4/kubernetes-src.tar.gz

It is based on the Kubernetes source at:
  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/v1.2.4

For Kubernetes copyright and licensing information, see:
  /usr/local/share/doc/kubernetes/LICENSES

admin@ip-172-20-0-9:~$
```

When you are finished with the Kubernetes cluster, you may terminate the AWS resources by running
`./clusters/kube-down.sh`. If you are using a new shell environement you will need to set the environment variables we
used above so `kube-down.sh` can find the right cluster.

You are now ready to [install Deis Workflow](install-aws.md)
